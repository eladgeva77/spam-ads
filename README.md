This application spams the 7 kingdows with ads.
I guess white walkers are so bad after all :)

Please follow the following steps to run the application
1) Download the files from github
2) run "npm install" under the directory "spam-ads-master\jonSnow" (this directory already exists)
3) run "ng serve" under the directory "spam-ads-master\jonSnow"
4) If you encounter compile issues, then run "npm install rxjs-compat" under the directory "spam-ads-master" (this directory already exists) and re run ng serve.
5) If you're still encountering issues, then go to the file "spam-ads-master\jonSnow\src\app\app.component.ts", make an insignificant change and save (while webpack is running)
6) Connect to http://localhost:4200 and enjoy the show :)
